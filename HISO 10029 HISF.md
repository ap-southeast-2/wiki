Issued in December 2022 by Te Whatu Ora (Health NZ), the Health Information Security Framework (HISF). The HISF is designed to support security and privacy in the health sector. 
- 2009 - Security essentials and included a set of security policies and procedures.
- 2013 - A technical specifications register was added
- 2015 - A fully revised second edition was published to bring the framework up-to-date with the International Organisation for Standardization (ISO).

Scope for the HISF includes all organisations that collect, process or store personal health information (PHI) and patient personally identifiable information (PPII) related to New Zealanders. The HISF establishes obligations under our framework for Te Tiriti o Waitangi, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

All personal health information is treated as MEDICAL IN CONFIDENCE and is covered by the Health Information Privacy Code 2020. The Health Information Privacy Code 2020 defines it's own requirements for privacy and security of personal health information.

Controls are aligned with NIST CSF five functional processes to identify, protect, detect, respond, and recover. Controls are defined for the following:
- HISO 10029: Health Information Security Framework (HISF)
-- HISO 10029.1 HISF for Hospitals - 75 controls.
-- HISO 10029.4 HISF for Suppliers - 66 controls.
