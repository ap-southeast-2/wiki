## NIST SP 800-37 - Risk Management Framework for Information Systems and Organizations: A System Life Cycle Approach for Security and Privacy

2.2 Risk Management Framework Steps And Structure
There are seven steps in the RMF; a preparatory step to ensure that organizations are ready to execute the process and six main steps. All seven steps are essential for the successful execution of the RMF. The steps are:

1. Prepare to execute the RMF from an organization- and a system-level perspective by establishing a context and priorities for managing security and privacy risk.

2. Categorize the system and the information processed, stored, and transmitted by the system based on an analysis of the impact of loss.

3. Select an initial set of controls for the system and tailor the controls as needed to reduce risk to an acceptable level based on an assessment of risk.

4. Implement the controls and describe how the controls are employed within the system and its environment of operation.

5. Assess the controls to determine if the controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired outcomes with respect to satisfying the security and privacy requirements.

6. Authorize the system or common controls based on a determination that the risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation is acceptable.

7. Monitor the system and the associated controls on an ongoing basis to include assessing control effectiveness, documenting changes to the system and environment of operation, conducting risk assessments and impact analyses, and reporting the security and privacy posture of the system.

## NIST SP 800-61 - Computer Security Incident Handling Guide

The major phases of the incident response process—preparation, detection and analysis, containment, eradication and recovery, and post-incident activity.

Preparation:
1. Would the organization consider this activity to be an incident? If so, which of the organization’s policies does this activity violate? (Section 2.1)
2. What measures are in place to attempt to prevent this type of incident from occurring or to limit its impact? (Section 3.1.2)

Detection and Analysis:
1. What precursors of the incident, if any, might the organization detect? Would any precursors cause the organization to take action before the incident occurred? (Sections 3.2.2, 3.2.3)
2. What indicators of the incident might the organization detect? Which indicators would cause someone to think that an incident might have occurred? (Sections 3.2.2, 3.2.3)
3. What additional tools might be needed to detect this particular incident? (Section 3.2.3)
4. How would the incident response team analyze and validate this incident? What personnel would be involved in the analysis and validation process? (Section 3.2.4)
5. To which people and groups within the organization would the team report the incident? (Section 3.2.7)
6. How would the team prioritize the handling of this incident? (Section 3.2.6)

Containment, Eradication, and Recovery:
1. What strategy should the organization take to contain the incident? Why is this strategy preferable to others? (Section 3.3.1)
2. What could happen if the incident were not contained? (Section 3.3.1)
3. What additional tools might be needed to respond to this particular incident? (Sections 3.3.1, 3.3.4)
4. Which personnel would be involved in the containment, eradication, and/or recovery processes? (Sections 3.3.1, 3.3.4)
5. What sources of evidence, if any, should the organization acquire? How would the evidence be acquired? Where would it be stored? How long should it be retained? (Sections 3.2.5, 3.3.2, 3.4.3)

Post-Incident Activity:
1. Who would attend the lessons learned meeting regarding this incident? (Section 3.4.1)
2. What could be done to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future? (Section 3.1.2)
3. What could be done to improve detection of similar incidents? (Section 3.1.2)
