## 5 Classes of fire

| Class | Extinguisher | Description |
|-|-|-|
| A | Water, Soda acid | For use with ordinary materials like cloth, wood and paper. |
| B | CO2, Soda acid | For use with combustible and flammable liquids like grease, gasoline, oil and oil-based paints. | 
| C | CO2 | For use with electrical equipment like appliances, tools or other equipment that is plugged into an outlet. Class C fire extinguishers use an agent that doesn't conduct electricity.
| D | Total immersion | For use with flammable metals. Often found in factories.
| K | Water mist, Fire blankets | For use with vegetable oils, animal oils and fats in cooking appliances. Often found in commercial kitchens. |

| Extinguisher | Class | Function |
|-|-|-|
| Soda acid | A, B | Supresses fuel. |
| CO2 | B, C | Removes oxygen. |
| Inert gas | B, C | Separates the fire triangle. |

- Inert gas: FM-200, Argon, Argonite, Inergen, not Halon!
