# Not all two-factor authentication (2FA) is equal

## Scenario #1

Two-factor authentication (2FA) is also known as multi-factor authentication (MFA) or two-step verification. 2FA helps to avoid the limitations associated with using a password alone. Let's walk through our first scenario to understand using a password verses using 2FA:
- Attack #1: An attacker is able to guess your password or your password is exposed as part of a security breach at an online company. The attacker uses your guessed or exposed password to access your online account.
- Defence #1: The attacker uses your guessed or exposed password but because they do not have your 2FA they are unable to access your online account.

## One-Time Passwords (OTP)

2FA challenge is typically implemented as a One-Time Password (OTP). A OTP is a 6-8 digit number that is generate by a mobile app, like Google Authenticator or Microsoft Authenticator. The mobile apps typically register a new website using a quick response (QR) code and generate new 6-8 digit OTPs every 30 seconds. Once setup you need both your password and OTP as the required 2FA.

There are user experience / inconvenience issues with typing OTPs so Google Prompt is another mobile app that works a little bit differently. Instead of OTPs, Google Prompt uses push notifications to ask your to confirm access requests. The issue with both OTPs and Google Prompt is that it relies on the user's ability to differentiate a legitimate request from phishing email or website, or through a scam like saying "Hello, I am calling from Microsoft. We think there is a problem with your computer".

## Scenario #2

Let's walk through our second scenario to understand using a OTP as our 2FA versus using FIDO:
- Attack #2: An attacker is able to trick you to share your password and OTP. This could be through a look-a-like phishing email or website, or through a scam like the Microsoft scam. Then using a man-in-the-middle style attacks, the attacker uses your OTP and password to access your online account.
- Defence #2: The attacker uses a man-in-the-middle style attack but because of FIDO, the 2FA device itself will not share the 2FA challenge with the attacker, and they are unable to access your online account.

## Fast IDentity Online (FIDO2)

FIDO2 uses a public / private key pair generated by the 2FA device for each online account. The public key is shared with and stored by the online company. The 2FA device will only share the 2FA challenge for your online account when the public key is available. This means that even if you accidentally fall for the look-a-like phishing email or website, or a scam like the Microsoft scam, the 2FA device will protect you from such an attack. The 2FA device simply will not let you.

2FA devices that support FIDO2 include the YubiKey 5 Series and Yubico Security Key Series that are available from the website below.
